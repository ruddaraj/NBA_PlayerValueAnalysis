# NBA Player Value Analysis: Identifying Underpaid and Overpaid Players
## Overview
- Goals:
   - Determine which players offer teams the best "bang for your buck".
   - Finding trends between player types and salary
   - Visualize relationships between advanced metrics and salary (Win-Shares, Box Plus Minus, Player Efficency Rating, ect)
     
- This project analyzed NBA player performance and salary data from the 24-25 regular season to identify which players are considered overpaid or underpaid based on their on-court contributions in relation to their yearly salary. Using data analytics and machine learning, I was able to estimate a players value and eventually find players with significant differences between their salary and performance.
