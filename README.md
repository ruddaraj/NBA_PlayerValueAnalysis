# NBA Player Value Analysis: Identifying Underpaid and Overpaid Players  üèÄ
## Overview
- Goals:
   - Determine which players offer teams the best "bang for your buck".
   - Finding trends between player types and salary
   - Visualize relationships between advanced metrics and salary (Win-Shares, Box Plus Minus, Player Efficency Rating, ect)
     
- This project analyzed NBA player performance and salary data from the 24-25 regular season to identify which players are considered overpaid or underpaid based on their on-court contributions in relation to their yearly salary. Using data analytics and machine learning, I was able to estimate a players value and eventually find players with significant differences between their salary and performance.
  
### Data Collection
- All data was aquired from https://www.basketball-reference.com/.
- Found 3 datasets: Per game statistics, Advanced Statistics, Player Contract data


### Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy) - Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- Seaborn and Matplotlib - Data Visualization
- Scikit-learn - linear regression, feature standardization
- Jupyter Notebook - Writing Python scripts
- VSCode - Main IDE used


# MAIN QUESTIONS
   1) How are salaries distributed by position and player type?
   2) Which type of players (3-pt shooters, facilitators, defenders, ect) tend to be the most cost-efficient?
   3) Can we predict a players "true value" salary based on performance stats?
   4) Which players are considered underpaid/overpaid relative to their predicted salary?

# Methodology

## Data Cleaning and Preperation
- Removed duplicate (traded) players
- Filterd for Players who played at least half the season (41)
- Filterd salary data for 24-25 season
- Merged multiple CSVs (Per Game, Advanced, and Salary)

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Visualized salary distributions by position and player type
- Highlighted outliers and trends using scatter plots and histograms

## Positional Analysis
- Filtered Data by position to analyze salary trends
- Found insights into positional specialization in relation to salary

## Player Type Classification
- Groupted Players as Scorers, Shooters, Defenders, or Facilitators based on rules/stat thresholds
- Future extension: Use ML techniques (KMeans Clustering) for unsupervised classification

## ML Regression Model
- Trained a linear regression model using selected performance metrics
- Predicted each player's expected salary
- Calculated the "Value Gap" = Actual Salary ‚àí Predicted Salary
